# StatPhase → NamePhase: Card Deal Animation Design

**Status:** Approved — pre-build
**Date:** 2026-05-16
**Scope:** The full animation sequence from StatView exit through card deal, flip, and expand into NamePhase

---

## Context

This spec covers the transition from `StatPhase` through the card deal sequence into `NamePhase`. The sequence replaces the old BrandView approach. There is no prescreen or calibration phase — the sequence begins at StatView.

The target feel is **Harry Potter magic**: the card landing is chaotic and physical (earned realism), then the auto-organize is impossibly smooth — like an invisible hand guiding it. The contrast between mess and impossible precision is the magic beat.

Reference HTML prototype: `Vayl OB Sequence — Complete Spec v2.md` (StatView → BrandView → NameView 1 section)

## Architecture

**Approach:** Hybrid — SwiftUI drives card position/transform/flip, Canvas handles table surface and atmosphere. `VaylCardBack` and `VaylCardFace` render as native SwiftUI views. `TableSurfaceView` receives a new `rimBurst` parameter for the impact glow.

**Phase ownership:**
- `VaylDirector` owns macro phase state: `.statView` → `.brandView` → `.nameInput`
- A local `CardDealPhase` state machine inside the brand phase view owns sub-animation state
- No child view advances `VaylDirector` directly — all dispatch intents

---

## Section 1 — Animation State Machine

```swift
enum CardDealPhase {
    case idle
    case dealing       // card in flight from dealer position
    case landing       // card hits table — rimBurst fires here
    case organizing    // card auto-drifts and rotates to center
    case settled       // placeholder copy beats play
    case flipping      // back → front, automatic after 1.2s timer
    case expanding     // card scales to fill screen
    case complete      // dispatches intent → VaylDirector → .nameInput
}
```

**Random seed:** Landing angle and offset are generated once when `.dealing` starts and stored as local `@State`. Values are consistent if the animation replays within a session.

**Auto-advance timer:** On `.settled`, a `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(1.2s)` fires to advance to `.flipping`. No user input required.

**Director handoff:** On `.complete`, the view dispatches an intent to `VaylDirector`. Director sets `phase = .nameInput`.

## Section 2 — Card Physics

### Deal (in-flight)

Card originates off-screen top-right (~110% x, -15% y).

Randomized per deal:
- Landing rotation: `CGFloat.random(in: -7...7)` degrees
- Landing offset: random within ~40pt radius of center — never perfectly centered

Rotation and offset animate with slightly different spring responses so they don't arrive simultaneously — the card naturally tilts as it decelerates, which reads as realistic in-flight physics.

```swift
Animation.interpolatingSpring(
    mass: 1.1,
    stiffness: 160,
    damping: 18,
    initialVelocity: 6
)
```

### Landing → Organize

On `.landing`: card snaps to random resting position with a heavier, more decisive spring. `rimBurst` spikes to `1.0` simultaneously.

After a 0.3s beat, `.organizing` begins. The card drifts to center and rotates to 0°:

```swift
// Critically damped — zero overshoot, zero wobble
// Eerily smooth. Not how physics works. That's the point.
Animation.spring(response: 0.72, dampingFraction: 1.0)
```

The card arrives exactly at center and stops. No settle. No wobble. Like it was always going to be there.

### Flip (automatic)

Two sequential `scaleEffect(x:)` passes — horizontal collapse and expand, no rotation:

- First half: `scaleX` 1.0 → 0.0
- Midpoint: `VaylCardBack` swaps for `VaylCardFace` (invisible at scaleX == 0, undetectable)
- Second half: `scaleX` 0.0 → -1.0 (mirrored expansion)

```swift
Animation.spring(response: 0.38, dampingFraction: 0.82)
// Applied to each half independently
```

---

## Section 3 — Table Border Glow Burst

`TableSurfaceView` receives a new parameter:

```swift
struct TableSurfaceView: View {
    let fade: Double
    let rimBurst: Double  // 0.0 = resting, 1.0 = full impact glow
}
```

**Contract preserved:** `TableSurfaceView` remains stateless. No internal animation. Caller (the brand phase view) owns the burst value and timing. `VaylDirector` does not know about `rimBurst` — it is local animation state, not macro phase state.

**Implementation:** Inside `drawSpectrumRim`, `rimBurst` multiplies the rim gradient opacities and the base pass opacity. At `rimBurst == 0`, normal resting rim. At `rimBurst == 1.0`, full spectrum arc flare.

**Timing:** On `.landing`, the parent view fires:

```swift
rimBurst = 1.0
withAnimation(.timingCurve(0.2, 0.8, 0.4, 1.0, duration: 0.6)) {
    rimBurst = 0.0
}
```

Sharp spike on card impact, long tail decay — like a physical impact ripple. The burst does not radiate directionally from the landing point — it illuminates the full arc uniformly, which reads as the table responding to the card, not a UI effect.

## Section 4 — Flip + Expand to NamePhase

### Expand

Scale + fade composite. The card's resting center and size are known. Target scale factor is calculated from geometry at render time:

```swift
let expandScale = screenHeight / cardHeight
```

No `matchedGeometryEffect` — requires namespace coordination across view boundaries, which conflicts with the OB canvas layering architecture.

During expand:
- `TableSurfaceView.fade` animates to `0.0` (table disappears)
- `rimBurst` fades to `0.0`
- Card alpha stays `1.0` until the card fully covers the screen
- Card then fades out, revealing `OnboardingAtmosphere(config: .name)` beneath

### Director handoff

`VaylDirector` advances to `.nameInput` at the moment the card is fully opaque at screen size — before the card fades out. This means the NamePhase atmosphere and UI are already rendering beneath the card as it fades, producing a seamless reveal.

## Full Sequence

| Beat | Phase | What Happens |
|------|-------|--------------|
| StatView exits | `.statView` | Stat dims, table bare, intro placeholder copy |
| Table settle | — | Copy plays, overhead light present |
| Card enters | `.dealing` | Top-right origin, random physics arc |
| Impact | `.landing` | Messy landing, `rimBurst` spikes |
| Organize | `.organizing` | Card glides impossibly smoothly to center |
| Copy beats | `.settled` | Placeholder copy, card breathes, 1.2s timer |
| Flip | `.flipping` | Automatic, back → front, "The Deep" revealed |
| Expand | `.expanding` | Card scales to screen, table fades |
| NamePhase | `.complete` → `.nameInput` | UI fades in, user is inside the card |

## Open Items

- Placeholder copy: exact strings TBD — will be authored separately
- `rimBurst` multiplier values inside `drawSpectrumRim`: TBD at build time, tuned visually on device
- Intro copy timing relative to card deal: TBD — copy may overlap deal start or precede it
- OB → App transition architecture: still unresolved per v2 spec, out of scope here

---

## Performance Notes

Per OB v2 spec performance rules:
- `.drawingGroup()` on every `VaylCard` instance — always
- `hasAnimated` flag on the brand phase view — full theatre on first visit, settled state on return
- `rimBurst` animation must fire within 16ms of landing haptic — perceptual unity with audio-haptic layer
- Test on physical device — simulator will not surface `.drawingGroup()` + material blur conflicts
